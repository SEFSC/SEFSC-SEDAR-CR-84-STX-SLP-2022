Stock Synthesis models were initially configured using an annual commercial catch time series and size compositions data that were aggregated across the available years for each source of length data. Model development proceeded stepwise from the simplest configuration to those of moderate complexity.

## Overview {#sec-methods-model-overview}

The SEDAR 84 model development process started with simple data-limited configurations, followed by exploring data-moderate configurations, individually and combined. The simplest configurations aggregated length compositions across years by implementing the super-period approach in Stock Synthesis. When using super-periods, the estimation model generates annual values, but the likelihood function will compare the expected composite to the data composite across the super-period. When using this approach on the size composition data, Stock Synthesis models will still aim to identify parameter values for selectivity that achieve a fit between the predicted and observed data.

The initial setup steps and description of the modeling scenarios documented in this report are listed in @tbl-ss3-stxslp. For the SEDAR 84 Stoplight Parrotfish assessment, the data-moderate considerations explored included: (a) indices of abundance, (b) annual fishery-independent size compositions, and (c) recruitment deviations. Additional model configurations were not pursued. For example, annual fishery-dependent size composition data were not considered due to low sample sizes. Similarly, alternative dome-shaped selectivity patterns and selectivity-related time blocks were not explored, based on the reviewed fishery dynamics in St. Croix.

The Stock Assessment Continuum Tool was used to develop the initial model setup by importing CSV input files and utilizing its Shiny application interface (@cope2024). Starting from the Continuum Tool (ct) model, a series of sequential modifications were applied to represent three key biological and data-related complexities: hermaphroditism (m1), continuous recruitment (m2), and increased catch uncertainty (m3).

This report focuses on the results and sensitivities associated with the m3 models, evaluated under the various data configurations described in the previous section. While a full discussion of sensitivity runs is provided later in the report, they are also summarized in @tbl-ss3-stxslp to help familiarize the reader with the terminology used throughout. For instance, model **v1_m3_s4** refers to the first scenario (**v1**, which includes an index and annual fishery-independent size data), the third level modification (**m3**, reflecting hermaphroditism, continuous recruitment, and higher catch uncertainty), and the fourth sensitivity scenario (**s4**, assuming one sex).

Due to the lack of an estimable spawner-recruit relationship across the explored models, a commonly used 40% spawning potential ratio (SPR) was used as a proxy for Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) and as the basis for management reference points. The SPR proxy reflects the ratio of expected lifetime reproductive potential under fished conditions compared to virgin conditions.
