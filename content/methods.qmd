Stock Synthesis models were initially configured using an annual commercial catch time series and size compositions data that were aggregated across the available years for each source of length data. Model development proceeded stepwise from the simplest configuration to those of moderate complexity.

## Overview {#sec-methods-model-overview}

The SEDAR 84 model development process started with simple data-limited configurations, followed by exploring data-moderate configurations, individually and combined. @tbl-overview provides the shorthand naming conventions used for SEDAR 84 assessments of Caribbean stoplight parrotfish. The simplest configurations aggregated length compositions across years by implementing the super-period approach in Stock Synthesis. When using super-periods, the estimation model generates annual values, but the likelihood function will compare the expected composite to the data composite across the super-period. When using this approach on the size composition data, Stock Synthesis models will still aim to identify parameter values for selectivity that achieve a fit between the predicted and observed data.

The data-moderate considerations explored across the stoplight parrotfish and yellowtail snapper SEDAR 84 assessments included incorporating (a) indices, (b) annual fishery-independent size composition, (c) annual fishery-dependent size composition, (d) recruitment deviations, (e) dome-shaped selectivity, and (f) time blocks. Not all of these considerations were explored for stoplight parrotfish. However, the process sets up a reproducible and adaptable workflow across species and islands of model development with sequential model steps that consider methodological and intentional stepwise model explorations combined across individual complexity considerations.

The considerations detailed in @tbl-overview that were relevant for the stoplight parrotfish assessment were (a) indices, (b) annual fishery-independent size composition, and (d) recruitment deviations. Annual fishery-dependent size data (c) was not explored due to the low sample size. Dome-shaped selectivity (e) and selectivity-related time blocks (f) were also not considerations that factor into the dynamics and data reviewed for the fishery in St. Croix. The initial setup steps and description of the modeling scenarios documented in this report are listed in @tbl-ss3-stxslp. 

The Stock Assessment Continuum Tool was used to develop the initial model setup by importing CSV input files and utilizing its user-friendly Shiny application interface (@cope2024). Starting from the Continuum Tool (ct) model, a series of sequential modifications were applied to represent three key biological and data-related complexities: hermaphroditism (m1), continuous recruitment (m2), and increased catch uncertainty (m3).

This report focuses on the results and sensitivities associated with the m3 models, evaluated under the various data configurations described in the previous section. While a full discussion of sensitivity runs is provided later in the report, they are also summarized in @tbl-ss3-stxslp to help familiarize the reader with the terminology used throughout. For instance, model **v1_m3_s4** refers to the first scenario variation (**v1**, which includes an index and annual fishery-independent size data), the third level modification (**m3**, reflecting hermaphroditism, continuous recruitment, and higher catch uncertainty), and the fourth sensitivity scenario (**s4**, assuming one sex).
