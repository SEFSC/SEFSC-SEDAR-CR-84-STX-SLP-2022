Stock Synthesis models were initially configured using an annual catch time series and compositions that were aggregated across the available years for each source of length data. Model development proceeded stepwise from the simplest configuration to those of moderate complexity.

## Overview {#sec-methods-model-overview}

The SEDAR 84 model development process started with simple data-limited configurations, followed by exploring data-moderate configurations, individually and combined. @tbl-overview provides the shorthand naming conventions used for SEDAR 84 assessments of Caribbean stoplight parrotfish. The simplest configurations aggregated length compositions across years by implementing the super-period approach in Stock Synthesis. When using super-periods, the estimation model generates annual values, but the likelihood function will compare the expected composite to the data composite across the super-period. When using this approach on the size composition data, Stock Synthesis models will still aim to identify parameter values for selectivity that achieve a fit between the predicted and observed data.

The data-moderate considerations explored in SEDAR 84 included incorporating (a) indices, (b) annual fishery-independent size composition, (c) annual fishery-dependent size composition, (d) recruitment deviations, (e) dome-shaped selectivity, and (f) time blocks. Not all of these considerations were explored for St. Croix Stoplight Parrotfish. However, the process sets up a reproducible and adaptable workflow across species and islands of model development with sequential model steps that consider methodological and intentional stepwise model explorations combined across individual complexity considerations.

The considerations detailed in @tbl-overview that were relevant for the stoplight parrotfish assessment were (a) indices, (b) annual fishery-independent size composition, and (d) recruitment deviations. Annual fishery-dependent size data (c) was not explored due to the low sample size. Dome-shaped selectivity (e) and selectivity-related time blocks (f) were also not considerations that factor into the dynamics and data reviewed for fishery in St. Croix. The initial setup steps and description of the modeling scenarios documented in this report are listed in @tbl-ss3-stxslp.
