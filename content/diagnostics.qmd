title: "Model Diagnostics"
---

Model diagnostics aimed to follow the conceptual process described by @carvalho2021. Their approach includes evaluating goodness of fit, information sources and structure, prediction skill, convergence, and model plausibility. Although @carvalho2021 advise detours and additional model explorations when initial diagnostic tests fail, advanced diagnostics, such as likelihood profiles, retrospective, and jitter analyses, were conducted even when initial tests failed to comprehensively communicate the various model configurations explored to the extent possible.

## Convergence

Three approaches were used to check for model convergence. They were investigating for the presence of (1) bounded parameters, (2) high final gradients, and (3) a positive definite hessian. As described by @carvalho2021 checking for bounded parameters can indicate discrepancies with data or model structure. Additionally, small final gradients and a positive definite hessian can indicate that the objective function achieved good convergence.

The models presented in this report all had a positive definite Hessian, indicating that each reached a local minimum and a locally optimal fit. None of the models had parameters that were bounded, suggesting the optimization was not constrained by parameter limits. However, all models showed high final gradients for F~MSY~, indicating poor convergence.

Despite achieving a solution and having unbounded parameters, the gradient warning for F~MSY~ raise concerns about model stability. The following sections further explore the convergence issues by examining parameter correlations, variances, and likelihood profiles to identify factors contributing to poor convergence and potential inconsistencies in the data.

## Correlation Analysis

High correlation among parameters can lead to flat response surfaces and poor model stability. By performing a correlation analysis, modeling assumptions that lead to inadequate configurations can be identified. Because of the highly parameterized nature of stock assessment models, some parameters are expected to be correlated (e.g., stock recruit parameters). However, many strongly correlated parameters (e.g., > 0.95) suggest reconsidering modeling assumptions and parameterization.

High correlations (> 0.95) were observed across nearly all _m2 model configurations (@tbl-corr). One particularly noteworthy correlation was between the estimates of initial fishing mortality (Initial F) and unfished recruitment (R0), which exceeded 0.99 in all models except for version v3_m2, where it was slightly lower but still substantial at -0.90.

In the initial default configurations of both the _m1 and _m2 models, the standard error on the initial equilibrium catch was fixed at a low value of 0.01. This tightly constrained the model to the input catch of 30 metric tons, effectively limiting flexibility in estimating the corresponding initial fishing mortality. To address this issue, the standard error was increased to 0.3, allowing the estimated initial catch to diverge from the fixed input value (@tbl-eqcatch). This adjustment reduced the overly strong correlation between Initial F and R0 by relaxing the constraint on initial fishing mortality.

Most models showed moderately high correlations (\> 0.90) between the two parameters used to define logistic selectivity: the size at peak selectivity and the width of the ascending limb. Correlations between these selectivity parameters are expected. While estimated values varied slightly among models, they produced similar size-based selectivity curves for the commercial fleet (*ADD SELECTIVITY FIGURE*).

## Evaluating Variance

To check for parameters with high variance,  parameter estimates are reported with their resulting standard deviations. @tbl-parm presents the model-estimated values and standard deviations for the main active parameters. While it’s important to consider the scale of each parameter, the results suggest that key parameters are not being estimated with high precision. In particular, the coefficients of variation for initial fishing mortality are relatively high across all models, indicating considerable uncertainty in these estimates. @fig-r0 illustrates how the estimate and uncertainty for the unfished recruitment (R0) changes throughout the sequential steps of model development. The uncertainty in response surface for key parameters are further examined later in the report using likelihood profiles.

Stock Synthesis also provides estimates and standard deviations for derived quantities such as annual and unfished spawning biomass depletion (as a fraction of unfished spawning biomass). @tbl-dq shows this information and it is also plotted in @fig-ssb and @fig-ssb-ratio.  

Compared to the other m3 models, Model v3_m2 had extremely highest uncertainty for fishing mortality and other derived quantities (@fig-f). The configurations for models v3_m2 and v7_m2 include estimation of recruitment deviations, the high uncertainty resulting from these model scenarios is expected due to the data limited nature of the data inputs.

## Jitter Analysis
Jitter analysis is a relatively simple method that can be used to assess model stability and to determine whether the search algorithm has found a global, as opposed to local, solution. The premise is that all starting values are randomly altered (or ‘jittered’) by an input constant value, and the model is rerun from the new starting values. If the resulting population trajectories across many runs converge to the same solution, this provides reasonable support that a global minimum has been obtained. This process is not fault-proof; no guarantee can ever be made that the ‘true’ solution has been found or that the model does not contain misspecification. However, if the jitter analysis results are consistent, it provides additional support that the model is performing well and has come to a stable solution. For this assessment, a jitter value of 0.2 was applied to the starting values, and 30 runs were completed. The jitter value defines a uniform distribution in cumulative normal space to generate new initial parameter values [@methot2020].

Consistent with earlier results indicating that the models reached local minima (positive definite Hessian), the jitter analysis also performed well across all model scenarios (@fig-jitter). Importantly, no jitter runs produced a lower likelihood than the best fit already identified for each model. (*RERUN AND INCREASE JITTER*)

## Residual Analysis 

The primary approach to address performance was a residual analysis of model fit to each data set (e.g., catch, length compositions, indices). Any temporal trend in model residuals or disproportionately high residual values can indicate model misspecification and poor performance. Ideally, residuals are randomly distributed, conform to the assumed error structure for that data source, and are not of extreme magnitude. Any extreme positive or negative residual patterns indicate poor model performance and potential unaccounted-for process or observation error.

### Catch

All models closely matched the observed catch data, which was expected given the data-limited configurations used. These setups don’t provide much additional information beyond the catch itself, so the model has little room to estimate catch values that differ from the input data. The effect of increasing the standard error on catch to 0.3 was to give the model more flexibility in estimating initial fishing mortality. This adjustment allowed the model to explore alternative fits while still remaining reasonable. This topic will also be revisited in the sensitivity analyses, where model runs with a lower catch standard error of 0.1 are compared. (*ADD PLOTS SHOWING EXACT ESTIMATE OF CATCH*)

### Indices
For the models without recruitment deviation being estimated (models b_m2, and v1_m2), the predicted National Coral Reef Monitoring Program index is flat (@fig-cpue). In the models with estimated recruitment deviations, there is some improved fit to the index, whereby the slightly improved fits. Notably, the error rate was higher in 2014 and 2015, and none of models fit well to the highest value observed in 2015 (@fig-cpue).

### Length compositions

The model fits to the length composition across all years are provided in @fig-lenfit. For the models without recruitment deviation being estimated (models b_m2, and v1_m2), the fits to the annual National Coral Reef Monitoring Program length composition data shown in @fig-lenfit-ncrmp were poor compared to those across all years and in @fig-lenfit. In these scenarios, the predicted composition is similar across years, which leads to overestimating the proportion of the smallest size and underestimating intermediate or large sizes in 2012, 2017, and 2021.

## Retrospective Analysis

A retrospective analysis is a helpful approach for addressing the consistency of terminal year model estimates (e.g., SSB, Recruits, Fs) and is often considered a sensitivity exploration of impacts on key parameters from changes in data. The analysis sequentially removes a year of data and reruns the model. Suppose the resulting estimates of derived quantities such as SSB or recruitment differ significantly. In such a case, serial over- or underestimation of important quantities can indicate that the model has unidentified process error and could require reassessing model assumptions. It is expected that removing data will lead to slight differences between the new terminal year estimates and the estimates for that year in the model with the complete data. Estimates in years before the terminal year may have increasingly reliable information on cohort strength. Therefore, slight differences are usually expected between model runs as more years of size composition data are sequentially removed. Ideally, the difference in estimates will be slight and randomly distributed above and below the estimates from the model with the complete data sets. 

The results of a five-year retrospective analysis are plotted in @fig-retro. When more than 3 years are removed, the estimates of key quantities change. The sensitivity of the results to the removal of 2019 and 2018 data, is likely the result truncating the fishery-independent National Coral Reef Monitoring program index to end in 2017, corresponding with the highest observed value (@fig-cpue). Particularly the severity of the retrospective pattern is most severe in the scenarios with recruitment deviations, models v3_m2 and v7_m2, with Mohn's rho statistics, 0.2 and 0.51, respectively.

## Likelihood Profiles

Profile likelihoods are used to examine the change in negative log-likelihood for each data source to address the stability of a given parameter estimate and to see how each data source influences the estimate. The analysis is performed by holding a given parameter at a constant value and rerunning the model. The model is run repeatedly over a range of reasonable parameter values. Ideally, the graph of change in likelihood values against parameter values will yield a well-defined minimum. When the profile plot shows conflicting signals or is flat across its range, the given parameter may be poorly estimated.

Typically, profiling is carried out for key parameters, particularly those defining the stock-recruit relationship (steepness, virgin recruitment, and sigma R). Profiles were explored across initial equilibrium catch, steepness, and virgin recruitment (R0).

## Sensitivity Runs

Sensitivity analyses were considered to evaluate the impact on key derived quantities. Sensitivities included considering alternatives for the CV on growth, the standard error associated with catch, the maximum age, the method used to model hermaphroditism and data weighting.
