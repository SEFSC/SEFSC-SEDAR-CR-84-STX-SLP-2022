title: "Model Diagnostics"
---

Model diagnostics aimed to follow the conceptual process described by @carvalho2021. Their approach includes evaluating goodness of fit, information sources and structure, prediction skill, convergence, and model plausibility. Although @carvalho2021 advise detours and additional model explorations when initial diagnostic tests fail, advanced diagnostics, such as likelihood profiles, retrospective, and jitter analyses, were conducted even when initial tests failed to comprehensively communicate the various model configurations explored.

## Convergence
Three approaches were used to check for model convergence. They were investigating for the presence of (1) bounded parameters, (2) high final gradients, and (3) a positive definite hessian. As described by @carvalho2021, checking for bounded parameters can indicate discrepancies with data or model structure. Additionally, small final gradients and a positive definite hessian can indicate that the objective function achieved good convergence.

The models presented in this report all had a positive definite Hessian, indicating that each reached a local minimum and a locally optimal fit. None of the models had parameters that were bounded, suggesting the optimization was not constrained by parameter limits. Finally, the parameter gradients in all models were small and well below 0.001, which is commonly used in the R4SS R package to identify large gradients (@tbl-parm).

## Correlation Analysis
High correlation among parameters can suggest model overparameterization and lead to poor model stability. By performing a correlation analysis, modeling assumptions that lead to inadequate configurations can be identified. Because of the highly parameterized nature of stock assessment models, some parameters are expected to be correlated (e.g., stock recruit parameters). However, many strongly correlated parameters suggest reconsidering modeling assumptions and parameterization.

High correlations (correlation coefficients greater than 0.95 or less than -0.95) were observed between the estimates of initial fishing mortality (Initial F) and unfished recruitment (R0), which exceeded -0.99 in all models except for version v3_m2, where it was slightly lower but still substantial at -0.90 (@tbl-corr).

In the initial default configurations of both the m1 and m2 model scenarios, the standard error on the initial equilibrium catch was fixed at a low value of 0.01. This tightly constrained the model to the input catch of 30 metric tons effectively limiting flexibility in estimating the corresponding initial fishing mortality. To address this issue, the standard error was increased to 0.3, allowing the estimated initial catch to diverge from the fixed input value (@tbl-eqcatch). This adjustment reduced the overly strong correlation between Initial F and R0 by relaxing the constraint on initial fishing mortality. The effects of increasing the standard error beyond 0.3 are discussed further in the sensitivity analyses section.

All m2 and m3 model scenarios showed moderately high correlations (\> 0.90) between the two parameters used to define the commercial fleet logistic selectivity: the length at peak selectivity and the width of the ascending limb. Correlations between these selectivity parameters is expected. While estimated values varied slightly among models, they produced similar length-based selectivity curves for the commercial fleet (@fig-m3-selectivity).

## Evaluating Variance
To check for parameters with high variance,  parameter estimates are reported with their resulting standard deviations. @tbl-parm presents the model-estimated values and standard deviations for the main active parameters. While it’s important to consider the scale of each parameter, the results suggest that key parameters are not being estimated with high precision. In particular, the coefficients of variation for initial fishing mortality are relatively high across all models, indicating considerable uncertainty in these estimates. 

@fig-m3-density illustrates how the estimate and uncertainty for the unfished recruitment (R0) and virgin spawning stock biomass change throughout the sequential steps of model development. In general, increasing the complexity of the model across the model scenarios explored results in lower values for both of these parameters. The uncertainty across the response surface for key parameters is further examined later in the report using likelihood profiles.

Stock Synthesis also provides estimates and standard deviations for derived quantities such as unfished spawning stock biomass, initial year spawning biomass, and the initial depletion. Initial depletion is defined as the initial biomass divided by the unfished biomass. @tbl-dq shows this information and it is also plotted in Figures [-@fig-m3-ratio] and [-@fig-m3-ssb].  

Compared to the other m3 model scenarios, Model v3_m3 had extremely high uncertainty for fishing mortality and the highest initial depletion reflected in the lowest spawning biomass ratio (SSB Initial/SSB Unfished) reported in @tbl-dq. This ratio is also plotted as a time series of total biomass relative to virgin spawning biomass in @fig-m3-ratio. All of the m3 model scenarios resulted in relatively high uncertainty and limited contrast, with most years encompassing the 95% confidence intervals across their respective entire time series (@fig-m3-dq). The sensitivity runs described later build on the exploration of uncertainty in these model scenarios and help interpret conditions under which all of the model scenarios increasingly converge.

## Jitter Analysis
Jitter analysis is a relatively simple method that can be used to assess model stability and to determine whether the search algorithm has found a global, as opposed to local, solution. The premise is that all starting values are randomly altered (or ‘jittered’) by an input constant value, and the model is rerun from the new starting values. If the resulting population trajectories across many runs converge to the same solution, this provides support that a global minimum has been obtained. This process is not fault-proof; no guarantee can ever be made that the ‘true’ solution has been found or that the model does not contain misspecification. However, if the jitter analysis results are consistent, it provides additional support that the model is performing well and has come to a stable solution. For this assessment, a jitter value of 0.2 was applied to the starting values, and 30 runs were completed. The jitter value defines a uniform distribution in cumulative normal space to generate new initial parameter values [@methot2020].

Consistent with earlier results indicating that the models reached local minima (positive definite Hessian), the jitter analysis also performed well across all model scenarios (@fig-jitter). Importantly, no jitter runs produced a lower likelihood than the best fit already identified for each model.

## Residual Analysis 
The primary approach to investigate model performance was a residual analysis of model fit to each data set (e.g., catch, length compositions, indices). Any temporal trend in model residuals or disproportionately high residual values can indicate model misspecification and poor performance. Ideally, residuals are randomly distributed, conform to the assumed error structure for that data source, and are not of extreme magnitude. Any extremely positive or negative residual patterns indicate poor model performance and potential unaccounted-for process or observation error.

### Catch

All models closely matched the observed 2012 - 2022 catch data, which was expected given the data-limited configurations. In these configurations, Stock Synthesis relies heavily on the input catch data, with minimal additional information to support estimation of values that differ from the observations. The effect of increasing the standard error on the catch to 0.3 during the model development m3 scenario was to give the model more flexibility in estimating initial equilibrium catch and corresponding initial fishing mortality. This adjustment allowed the model to explore alternative fits while remaining informed by the assumption of a larger level of historically sustained catch. Increasing the standard error from 0.01 in the m2 model scenarios to 0.3 in the m3 model scenarios resulted in lower estimates of the initial equilibrium catch (@tbl-eqcatch). This topic will  be revisited in the sensitivity analyses, where model runs with even higher catch standard error of 2 are compared. Additional justifications for further allowing the estimated initial equilibrium catch to differ from the assumed initial equilibrium catch of 30 metric tons is further investigated via likelihood profiles (See @sec-daignostics-eqcatch-profile). 

### Indices
For the models without recruitment deviation being estimated (model scenarios b_m2, and v1_m2), the predicted National Coral Reef Monitoring Program index is flat (@fig-cpue). In the model scenarios with estimated recruitment deviations (v3_m3 and v7_m3), there is some improved fit to the index. Notably, the highest uncertainty in the index was observed in 2015 and 2017, and none of the models fit well with the highest value observed in 2017 (@fig-cpue).

### Length compositions
@fig-lenfit shows the cumulative fit across all years between the observed and predicted length composition for the two model scenarios that had aggregated length data (a_m3 and v3_m3). Figures [-@fig-lenfit-b], [-@fig-lenfit-v1], and [-@fig-lenfit-v7] provide the cumulative and the year-specific length compositions for the model scenarios that included annual fishery-independent length data (b_m3, v1_m3, and v7_m3).

Among the models with the annual fishery-independent length data (b_m3, v1_m3, and v7_m3), the model with recruitment deviation being estimated (v7_m3), has improved fits to the annual National Coral Reef Monitoring Program length composition data (@fig-lenfit-v7-2). In the scenarios without recruitment deviations (b_m3 and v_m3), the predicted composition is identical across years, which leads to overestimating the proportion of the smallest lengths and underestimating intermediate or large lengths in 2012, 2017, and 2021 (Figures [-@fig-lenfit-b-2] and [-@fig-lenfit-v1-2]). This is also evident in @fig-meanlen where the observed and predicted mean length by year are plotted. 

## Retrospective Analysis
A retrospective analysis is a helpful approach for investigating the consistency of terminal year model estimates (e.g., SSB, Recruits, Fs) and is often considered a sensitivity exploration of impacts on key parameters from changes in data [@carvalho2021]. The analysis sequentially removes a year of data and reruns the model. Suppose the resulting estimates of derived quantities such as SSB or recruitment differ significantly. In such a case, serial over- or underestimation of important quantities can indicate that the model has an unidentified process error and could require reassessing model assumptions. It is expected that removing data will lead to slight differences between the new terminal year estimates and the estimates for that year in the model with the complete time series of data. Estimates in years before the terminal year may have increasingly reliable information on cohort strength. Therefore, slight differences are usually expected between model runs as more years of length composition data are sequentially removed. Ideally, the difference in estimates will be slight and randomly distributed above and below the estimates from the model with complete data set time series. 

The results of a five-year retrospective analysis are plotted in Figures -@fig-retro and -@fig-retro2. When more than 3 years are removed, the estimates of key quantities change. The sensitivity to the removal of 2019 and 2018 data reflect some model instability. Although all retrospectives show wide 95% confidence intervals, the retrospective pattern was most divergent in the scenario with recruitment deviations and annual fishery-independent length data, scenario v7_m3.

## Likelihood Profiles
Profile likelihoods are used to assess the stability of parameter estimates by examining changes in the negative log-likelihood for each data source and evaluating the influence of each source on the estimate. The analysis is performed by holding a given parameter at a constant value and rerunning the model. The model is run repeatedly over a range of reasonable parameter values. Ideally, the graph of change in likelihood values against parameter values will yield a well-defined minimum. When the profile plot shows conflicting signals or is flat across its range, the given parameter may be poorly estimated.

Typically, profiling is carried out for key parameters, particularly those defining the stock-recruit relationship (steepness, virgin recruitment, and sigma R). Profiles were explored across virgin recruitment (R0), initial equilibrium catch, and steepness.

### Unfished Recruitment (R0)
@fig-profile-r0 shows the profile likelihood for the natural log of the unfished recruitment parameter of the Beverton – Holt stock-recruit function for St. Croix Stoplight Parrotfish across model scenarios (a_m3, b_m3, v1_m3, v3_m3, and v7_m3). All models show conflicting signals and relatively poorly defined minimums, with a range of equally plausible values reflected by only small changes in likelihood. @fig-profile-r0-msyspr shows the corresponding change in the MSY SPR 40% across the range of unfished recruitment values explored. 

### Initial Equilibrium Catch {#sec-daignostics-eqcatch-profile}
@fig-profile-eqcatch  shows the profile likelihood for the initial equilibrium catch for St. Croix Stoplight Parrotfish across model scenarios (a_m3, b_m3, v1_m3, v3_m3, and v7_m3). Except for model scenario v3_m3, the models suggest improved fit associated with smaller values of fixed initial equilibrium catch. Meanwhile, v3_m3 shows a minimum at 24 metric tons. @fig-profile-eqcatch-msyspr shows the corresponding change in the MSY SPR 40% across the range of initial equilibrium catch values explored. This suggests that given further flexibility the initial equilibrium may be estimated lower and was further examined through sensitivity runs.

### Steepness
@fig-profile-k shows the profile likelihood for the steepness parameter of the Beverton – Holt
stock-recruit function for St. Croix Stoplight Parrotfish across model scenarios (a_m3, b_m3, v1_m3, v3_m3, and v7_m3). Except for model scenario a_m3, all models show lower likelihoods associated with higher values of steepness, driven by the fit to the length data. @fig-profile-k-msyspr shows the corresponding change in the MSY SPR 40% across the range of steepness values explored. 

## Sensitivity Runs

Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the impact of key model assumptions on derived quantities. Details of the process and naming conventions are provided in @tbl-ss3-stxslp. The analyses explored alternative assumptions for the CV on growth, fixed input for maximum age-informed mortality, the modeling approach for hermaphroditism, and the standard error applied to catch data.

For each model scenario and sensitivity run:

-   @tbl-eqcatch provides the initial equilibrium catch
-   Tables [-@tbl-est-msy] and [-@tbl-msy] provide the MSY proxy (based on SPR 40%)
-   @tbl-msra summarizes the fishing mortality rate and spawning stock biomass ratios relative to the rate and biomass of the stock associated with the MSY proxy (based on SPR 40%)

### Growth CV
The first sensitivity scenario (s1) assumed the coefficient of variation (CV) for young fish was increased from 0.15 to 0.25. Of all the sensitivities explored, the m3_s1 sensitivities resulted in the smallest change to the derived quantities relative to the corresponding m3 sensitivity model configurations (Tables [-@tbl-eqcatch], [-@tbl-est-msy], [-@tbl-msy], and [-@tbl-msra]). Growth is a critical process in all stock assessment models, and in this assessment, the CV for young fish was a particularly relevant sensitivity to examine due to the large number of small individuals (less than 11 cm) observed in the fishery-independent survey length compositions. While additional sensitivities related to growth were considered, they will be revisited in the discussion section as part of the research recommendations. The current models use the best available growth parameters from @riverahernández2024.

### Natural Mortality
The second sensitivity scenario (s2) explored a lower natural mortality of 0.18, corresponding to a higher maximum age of 30 years. Although the maximum age is often larger than the maximum age observed, particularly for species that have sustained historical fishing pressure, the @hamel2015 method estimates natural mortality based on the maximum observed age. In this assessment, age is the only factor used to inform the estimate of natural mortality, making it important to consider the implications of assuming a lower M, which reflects a less productive stock. The m3_s2 sensitivity models showed notable differences from the corresponding m3 configurations. These differences included lower initial equilibrium catch, reduced MSY estimates, lower spawning stock biomass ratios, and higher fishing mortality ratios (Tables [-@tbl-eqcatch], [-@tbl-est-msy], [-@tbl-msy], and [-@tbl-msra]).

### Single Sex Model
The third sensitivity scenario (s3) explored an alternative method for parameterizing hermaphroditism. This approach used a female-only model, accounting for sex transition by reducing fecundity rather than explicitly modeling males. Interestingly, this configuration produced estimates of initial catch that were identical to the corresponding m3 models, slightly higher MSY estimates, similar spawning stock biomass ratios, and slightly lower fishing mortality ratios (Tables [-@tbl-eqcatch], [-@tbl-est-msy], [-@tbl-msy], and [-@tbl-msra]). This result demonstrates that the direct parameterization—despite its caveats, particularly for species where not all females transition, can be restructured differently while yielding broadly consistent outcomes.

However, a key limitation of the m3_s3 single-sex models is the inability to capture potential sperm limitation due to the disproportionate removal of males, which may increase the risk of reduced reproductive output. As such, both model configurations provide useful perspectives and highlight the need for additional data and consideration to fully characterize uncertainty related to hermaphroditic biology in Stoplight Parrotfish. This uncertainty may represent a greater risk of overfishing compared to gonochoric species. 

### Standard Error on Catch
The fourth sensitivity scenario (s4) examined the effect of further relaxing the information that informs the initial model conditions.  In the m3 model scenarios, a standard error of 0.3 was applied to the landings data (see @sec-data-fleet-catch). Compared to the m2 model scenarios, this resulted in lower estimates of initial equilibrium catch. However, likelihood profiles (see @sec-daignostics-eqcatch-profile) showed improved fit at even lower fixed estimates of equilibrium catch. This led to the exploration of increased input uncertainty using a standard error of 2.0 associated with the input equilibrium catch.

Effectively, this provides greater flexibility in estimating initial conditions, which are known to be difficult to resolve without longer time series. The m3_s4 sensitivities produced much lower estimates of initial catch and MSY, higher fishing mortality ratios, and similar biomass ratios compared to the m3 models (Tables [-@tbl-eqcatch], [-@tbl-est-msy], [-@tbl-msy], and [-@tbl-msra]).

These results highlight the significance of uncertainty in initial conditions. While the model fit improved with lower assumed historical catches, this also suggested a less productive stock. This sensitivity underscores the value of longer historical data series. Without them, there is considerable uncertainty in defining the initial conditions, and the m3_s4 results imply that if early landings were smaller than assumed in the M3 models, the stock may be less productive.

@fig-s4-density shows that the estimates and associated uncertainty for unfished recruitment (R0) and virgin spawning stock biomass in the m3_s4 sensitivity scenarios are shifted toward smaller values compared to the m3 model results (See @fig-m3-density). The time series of derived quantities for the m3_s4 scenarios are provided in @fig-s4-dq and appear broadly similar to those from the m3 models shown in @fig-m3-dq.

### Standard Error on Catch and Natural Mortality
The fifth sensitivity scenario (s5) explored the combined implications of two key sensitivities that had notable effects on model outcomes: increased uncertainty around initial equilibrium catch and lower natural mortality associated with higher maximum age. By evaluating both assumptions simultaneously, this scenario investigates the compounding uncertainty associated with the baseline M3 model configurations.

The combined effect of these changes resulted in lower estimates of MSY and initial catch and substantially higher estimates of relative fishing mortality (Tables [-@tbl-eqcatch], [-@tbl-est-msy], [-@tbl-msy], and [-@tbl-msra]). As shown in @fig-s5-density, the estimates and uncertainty for unfished recruitment (R0) and virgin spawning stock biomass in the m3_s5 models are shifted to smaller values and show more consistency across configurations. The time series of derived quantities in @fig-s5-dq indicate that the m3_s5 models converge on lower spawning output and higher fishing mortality relative to the M3 scenarios.

### Single Sex Model, Standard Error on Catch, and Natural Mortality
Similar to the s3 sensitivity run, the sixth and final sensitivity scenario (s6) was conducted to evaluate whether the dynamics and implications observed in the s5 scenario persisted when the model was reconfigured as a single-sex model. The results from the m3_s6 sensitivity runs were closely aligned with those of the m3_s5 scenarios, indicating that the combined effects of lower natural mortality and increased uncertainty in initial catch are robust to the choice of sex structure in the model (Tables [-@tbl-eqcatch], [-@tbl-est-msy], [-@tbl-msy], and [-@tbl-msra]).
