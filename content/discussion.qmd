The diagnostics presented in the report highlight various caveats, largely associated with the relatively few data inputs available for the present assessment. Furthermore, the data lack contrast, resulting in which parameters high uncertainty and flat solution spaces.

These results indicate model structure discrepancies with models v3_m2 and v7_m2. These models lack information with which to base estimate of recruitment deviations (@fig-recruits). Because the length data for model v3_m2 are aggregated across the available years, this model is most similar to an age structured production model. Although the recruitment deviations for model v3_m2 are small, the correlation between R0 and initial fishing mortality is still concerning particularly since the initial equilibrium fishing mortality profile showed very small changes in likelihood over a large range of equilibrium catch inputs.
