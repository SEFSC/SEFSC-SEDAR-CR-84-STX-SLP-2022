This assessment presents a suite of model configurations developed to address key uncertainties in data and model structure, using an integrated framework to characterize the stock status of stoplight parrotfish in St. Croix. Overall, the results broadly indicate that overfishing is not occurring and the stock is not overfished. Despite the broad range of scenarios explored, nearly all model configurations supported this conclusion, with only one sensitivity (m3_s6) reflecting an overfishing status @tbl-msra. Nonetheless, diagnostics and sensitivities highlighted critical caveats, primarily stemming from limited and low-contrast data inputs.

A major source of uncertainty stems from the unknown initial catch conditions. The short time series, coarse resolution in length binning, and absence of early fishery information make it challenging for the models to resolve the historical state of the stock. 

Natural mortality and assumptions about the historical catch levels were two of the most influential parameters across model sensitivities. The combined sensitivity scenario (s5) showed that allowing the model to estimate initial catch and assuming lower natural mortality led to lower MSY estimates and higher fishing mortality ratios. These patterns were robust across both sex-structured and single-sex model configurations. These outcomes reinforce the value of structured sensitivity analyses to explore uncertainty and variability in model results. Looking ahead, future research should consider the development of model grids or ensemble approaches to formally capture uncertainty and improve the robustness of management advice.

Recruitment deviations, when estimated, are particularly uncertain, given the limited years of available data and large length bins. However, the availability of fishery-independent length data from the National Coral Reef Monitoring Program provides a valuable information source. The observed abundance of small fish may allow better inference of recruitment in future assessments. Finer resolution data (e.g., using 1 cm bins for specific years) could improve model performance and reduce uncertainty.

Integrated models such as Stock Synthesis are powerful not only for synthesizing multiple data sources but also for making key assumptions explicit and testable. Without this flexibility, assessments risk producing outputs that must be taken at face value, with little opportunity to evaluate the effects of underlying assumptions.

While not every species will have sufficient data for an integrated assessment, wherever possible, structured scenario testing—such as that conducted here—should be pursued to explore alternative hypotheses and better understand the drivers of population dynamics. Such efforts strengthen the scientific foundation for management advice and help balance the need for both rigorous and practical assessment frameworks.

Given that stoplight parrotfish is currently the only parrotfish species in the complex with a SEDAR assessment, it may be worth reconsidering if catch limits for the entire parrotfish unit should be based on the combined historical average landings of two indicator species, as currently implemented, particularly if stoplight parrotfish catch continues to represent a significant portion of the total. 

Additionally, this assessment assumes an open population with recruitment not tightly linked to local spawning stock. This assumption could benefit from future exploration of regional connectivity, as it has implications for both model structure and management scale. If connectivity across islands is strong, larger-scale stock definitions or spatially explicit metapopulation modeling approaches may be warranted.

Finally, the stepwise modeling approach used in this assessment offers a framework that could be applied to other Caribbean species. Expanding the approach through targeted data collection and method development could improve the timeliness and robustness of stock assessments across the region. This will require continued support for long-term monitoring programs, higher-resolution data collection, and investment in model development and bridging exercises to deliver science-based, real-time management advice.
