This assessment presents a suite of model configurations developed to address key uncertainties in data and model structure, using an integrated framework to characterize the stock status of stoplight parrotfish in St. Croix. While the results broadly indicate that overfishing is not occurring and the stock is not overfished, the diagnostics and sensitivities explored in this report highlight critical caveats—primarily due to limited and low-contrast data inputs.

A major source of uncertainty stems from the unknown initial conditions. The short time series, coarse resolution in length binning, and absence of early fishery information make it challenging for the models to resolve the historical state of the stock. Although the input standard error on landings was relaxed in some configurations to reduce assumptions, likelihood profiles revealed conflicts and flat solution spaces, signaling weak data contrast and limited signal for estimating key parameters like initial catch and recruitment.

Recruitment deviations, when estimated, are particularly uncertain, given the limited years of available data and large length bins. However, the availability of fishery-independent length data from the National Coral Reef Monitoring Program provides a valuable information source. The observed abundance of small fish may allow better inference of recruitment in future assessments. Finer resolution data (e.g., using 1 cm bins for specific years) could improve model performance and reduce uncertainty.

Natural mortality and assumptions about the historical catch levels were two of the most influential parameters across model sensitivities. The combined sensitivity scenario (s5) showed that increasing uncertainty in initial catch and assuming lower natural mortality led to lower MSY estimates and higher fishing mortality ratios. These patterns were robust across both sex-structured and single-sex model configurations.

Importantly, despite the broad range of explored scenarios, nearly all model configurations concluded that overfishing is not occurring and the stock is not overfished—except for a few sensitivities (e.g., m3_s6 for overfishing, and v3_m3_s2, v3_m3_s5, and v3_m3_s6 for overfished status) which reflected more pessimistic assumptions. This reinforces the value of exploring uncertainty via structured sensitivities and suggests a future direction toward developing model grids or ensembles to guide management advice.

While integrated models such as Stock Synthesis offer powerful tools for evaluating stock dynamics using multiple data sources, it may also be useful to explore simpler alternative models and to simulation test assumptions and risks of overparameterization. Further research into model complexity and parsimony would help “right-size” assessment frameworks to match data richness.

Given that stoplight parrotfish is currently the only parrotfish species in the complex with a full SEDAR-based assessment, it may be worth reconsidering if catch limits for the entire parrotfish unit should be based on the combined historical average landings of two indicator species, as currently implemented, particularly if stoplight parrotfish catch continues to represent a significant portion of the total. 

Additionally, this assessment assumes an open population with recruitment not tightly linked to local spawning stock. This assumption could benefit from future exploration of regional connectivity, as it has implications for both model structure and management scale. If connectivity across islands is strong, larger-scale stock definitions or spatially explicit metapopulation modeling approaches may be warranted.

Finally, the stepwise, reproducible approach used in this assessment offers a framework that could be applied to other data-limited Caribbean species. Expanding the approach through targeted data collection and method development could improve the timeliness and robustness of stock assessments across the region. This will require continued support for long-term monitoring programs, higher-resolution data collection, and investment in model development and bridging exercises to deliver science-based, real-time management advice.
