The stoplight parrotfish (Sparisoma viride) is a sequential protogynous hermaphrodite that inhabits coral reefs in the Caribbean Sea, Florida, Gulf of Mexico, Bermuda, and Brazil. It is an herbivorous species that is targeted in reef fish fisheries throughout much of the Caribbean, including St. Croix, USVI.

## Management

St. Croix stoplight parrotfish is managed under the St. Croix Fishery Management Plan [@crabtree]. In 2023, the Caribbean Fisheries Management Council transitioned from species-based to island-based fisheries management (@fig-uscar). The management measures in the new island-based fishery management plans became effective on October 13, 2022. 

The Parrotfish 2 stock complex includes two indicator stocks and five other species. The indicator species are stoplight parrotfish and redtail parrotfish (Sparisoma chrysopterum). The allowable biological catch for the complex was established using tier 4a of the 4-tired ABC control rule. The allowable biological catch and the annual catch limit are 85,135 and 72,365 pounds whole weight, respectively.

The Southeast Fisheries Science Center provided a SEDAR 84 Data Workshop working paper summarizing federal management actions for stoplight parrotfish in St. Croix. On August 29, 2013, a 9-inch federal size limit was instituted by Final Regulatory Amendment 4. The size limit only applies in the U.S. EEZ surrounding St. Croix, defined as the federal waters ranging from 3 to 200 nautical miles (nm) (5.6 – 370 kilometers \[km\]) from the nearest coastline point of the U.S. Virgin Islands (@fig-eez).

## Assessment History

Before the current assessment, only one stock assessment had been attempted for St. Croix stoplight parrotfish [@sedar2016]. The St. Croix Stoplight Parrotfish SEDAR 46 evaluations were performed using the Data-Limited Methods Toolkit [@carruthers2018]. The approach applied data-limited stock assessment models and management procedures. Ultimately, the results were not used for management advice.
