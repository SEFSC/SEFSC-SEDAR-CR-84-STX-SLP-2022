**Stock Synthesis was the modeling approach applied in this assessment because of its compatibility with the available data and consistent with standard practices.**

Stock Synthesis is a statistical catch-at-age model that uses a population model, an observation model, and an estimation model and applies a likelihood function in the estimation process [@methot2020]. Stock Synthesis, commonly referred to as SS3, has been applied extensively worldwide for stock assessment evaluations [@methot2013]. It has also been used for previous data-limited and data-moderate SEDAR assessments, including the SEDAR 57 assessments and subsequent updates for Caribbean Spiny Lobster, and the SEDAR 80 assessments for Queen Triggerfish [@sedar2019; @sedar2022].

The Stock Synthesis modeling framework is a compatible tool for SEDAR stock assessments in the U.S. Caribbean because it can accommodate a wide range of model complexities, from data-limited to highly detailed assessments [@cope2024]. Stock Synthesis allows for the characterization of stock, fishing fleet, and survey dynamics through various parameters, which can be either fixed based on external data or estimated when sufficient assessment data are available. Additionally, it can incorporate complex biological dynamics, such as hermaphroditism and continuous recruitment, which are critical for accurately assessing St. Croix Stoplight Parrotfish.

Finally, R packages such as r4ss and ss3diags facilitate critical evaluations of model reliability and model comparisons [@taylor2021; @carvalho2021]. For example, R4SS provides visualization and diagnostic tools to summarize and interpret fit, convergence, and key output metrics. SS3diags focuses on retrospective analyses, hind-casting, and residual pattern evaluations. The integration of these tools allows rigorous uncertainty analysis, streamlined sensitivity analyses, and enhanced transparency in decision-making.
