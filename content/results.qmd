## Model Diagnostics

### Convergence

All three models presented in this report had a positive definite Hessian, indicating that each reached a local minimum and a locally optimal fit. None of the models had parameters that were bounded, suggesting the optimization was not constrained by parameter limits. However, all models showed high final gradients for F~MSY~, indicating poor convergence.

Despite achieving a solution and having unbounded parameters, the gradient warning for F~MSY~ raise concerns about model stability. The following sections further explore the convergence issues by examining parameter correlations, variances, and likelihood profiles to identify factors contributing to poor convergence and potential inconsistencies in the data.

@fig-r0 illustrates how the estimate and uncertainty for the unfished recruitment (R0) changes throughout the sequential steps of model development. The uncertainty in these key parameters is further examined later in the report using likelihood profiles.

### Jitter Analysis

Consistent with earlier results indicating that the models reached local minima (positive definite Hessian), the jitter analysis also performed well across all model scenarios. Importantly, no jitter runs produced a lower likelihood than the best fit already identified for each model.
