## Model Diagnostics

### Convergence

All three models presented in this report had a positive definite Hessian, indicating that each reached a local minimum and a locally optimal fit. None of the models had parameters that were bounded, suggesting the optimization was not constrained by parameter limits. However, all models showed high final gradients for F~MSY~, indicating poor convergence.

Despite achieving a solution and having unbounded parameters, the gradient warning for F~MSY~ raise concerns about model stability. The following sections further explore the convergence issues by examining parameter correlations, variances, and likelihood profiles to identify factors contributing to poor convergence and potential inconsistencies in the data.
