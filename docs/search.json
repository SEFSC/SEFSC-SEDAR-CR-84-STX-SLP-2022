    "text": "Executive Summary\nThe SEDAR 84 St. Croix stoplight parrotfish (Sparisoma viride) stock assessment process consisted of four webinars between April 2024 and October 2024. The data available for the assessment included:\n\nAn annual species-specific catch time series from commercial logbooks\nFishery-dependent length compositions from commercial port sampling\nFishery-independent length compositions from a reef fish survey\nA fishery-independent index of abundance from a reef fish survey\nLife history information from otolith analysis and gonad histology\n\nThe assessment used Stock Synthesis, a statistical catch-at-age model (Methot et al., 2020). Stock Synthesis V3.30.22 models were initially configured with an annual catch time series, while length composition data from each source were aggregated across all available years. Model development proceeded stepwise from the simplest configuration to those of moderate complexity. Those sequential steps included the inclusion of the index of abundance and annual fishery-independent length compositions. Models were run with and without the estimation of recruitment deviations. Finally, sensitivities of assessment outcomes were investigated using alternative inputs for longevity-informed natural mortality, coefficient of variation on growth, parameterization of hermaphroditism, and uncertainty on initial model equilibrium catch.\nModel diagnostics assessed convergence, fit, and consistency using gradients, residuals, likelihood profiles, hindcast cross-validation, and jitter analyses. Those diagnostics revealed that, although data contrast was limited and recruitment estimates were highly uncertain, the available length and catch data—particularly from fishery-independent sources—provided information that the models can use to determine potential catch advice, particularly in a grid or model ensemble approach that accounts for key model assumptions and data-limited caveats.\nSensitivity analyses evaluated the effects of assumptions about natural mortality, growth variability, hermaphroditism, and initial equilibrium catch conditions. While these scenarios showed that key uncertainties can influence estimated productivity and biological reference points, nearly all models across the suite supported the conclusion that overfishing is not occurring and the stock is not overfished. A few sensitivity runs did indicate potential concern under specific combinations of assumptions, particularly with lower initial equilibrium catch and higher natural mortality.\n\n\n\n\nMethot, R.

    "text": "1.1 Management\nThe stoplight parrotfish (Sparisoma viride) is a sequential protogynous hermaphrodite that inhabits coral reefs in the Caribbean Sea, Florida, Gulf of Mexico, Bermuda, and Brazil. It is an herbivorous species that is targeted in reef fish fisheries throughout much of the Caribbean, including St. Croix, USVI.\nSt. Croix stoplight parrotfish is managed under the St. Croix Fishery Management Plan (Crabtree, 2019). In 2023, the Caribbean Fisheries Management Council transitioned from species-based to island-based fisheries management (Figure 8.1). The management measures in the new island-based fishery management plans became effective on October 13, 2022.\nThe Parrotfish Two stock complex includes two indicator stocks and five other species. The indicator species are stoplight parrotfish and redtail parrotfish (Sparisoma chrysopterum). The allowable biological catch for the complex was established using Tier 4a of the 4-tiered control rule. The allowable biological catch and the annual catch limit are 85,135 and 72,365 pounds whole weight, respectively.\nA SEDAR 84 Data Workshop working paper summarizes federal management actions for stoplight parrotfish in St. Croix (Malone, 2024). On August 29, 2013, a 9-inch federal size limit was instituted by Final Regulatory Amendment 4. The size limit only applies to the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone surrounding St. Croix, which is defined as the federal waters ranging from 3 to 200 nautical miles (nm) (5.6 – 370 kilometers [km]) from the nearest coastline point of the U.S. Virgin Islands (Figure 8.2).",

    "text": "1.3 Modeling Framework\nStock Synthesis V3.30.22 was the modeling approach applied in the current SEDAR 84 assessment because of compatibility with the available data and consistency with standard practices.\nStock Synthesis is a statistical catch-at-age model that uses a population model, an observation model, and an estimation model and applies a likelihood function in the estimation process (Methot et al., 2020). Stock Synthesis, commonly referred to as SS3, has been applied extensively worldwide for stock assessment evaluations (Methot & Wetzel, 2013). It has also been used for previous data-limited and data-moderate SEDAR assessments, including the SEDAR 57 assessments and subsequent updates for Caribbean Spiny Lobster (Panulirus argus), and the SEDAR 80 assessments for Queen Triggerfish (Balistes vetula) (SEDAR, 2019, 2022).\nThe Stock Synthesis modeling framework is a compatible tool for SEDAR stock assessments in the U.S. Caribbean because it can accommodate a wide range of model complexities, from data-limited to highly detailed assessments (Cope, 2024). Stock Synthesis allows for the characterization of stock, fishing fleet, and survey dynamics through various parameters, which can be either fixed based on external data or estimated when sufficient assessment data are available. Additionally, it can incorporate complex biological dynamics, such as hermaphroditism and continuous recruitment, which are critical for accurately assessing St. Croix stoplight parrotfish.\nFinally, R packages such as r4ss and ss3diags facilitate critical evaluations of model reliability and model comparisons (Carvalho et al., 2021; Taylor et al., 2021). For example, R4SS provides visualization and diagnostic tools to summarize and interpret fit, convergence, and key output metrics. SS3diags focuses on retrospective analyses, hind-casting, and residual pattern evaluations. The integration of these tools allows rigorous uncertainty analysis, streamlined sensitivity analyses, and enhanced transparency in decision-making.\n\n\n\n\nCarruthers, T. R., & Hordyk, A. R.

    "text": "2.1.1 Catch\nThe catch data for the commercial fleet came from the Caribbean Commercial Logbook program (Martínez Rivera et al., 2024). Beginning in 1996, part of the commercial landings was reported by species groups (e.g., snappers, groupers, parrotfishes, surgeonfishes, etc.), and by gear (hook and line, gill net, SCUBA, trap, etc.). All commercial fishery data reports included species groups beginning in 1998. In July of 2011, commercial landings were reported by species and gear. Various diving gears were combined to establish a dive gear group since the catch of stoplight parrotfish in St. Croix from this group made up 80% of the reported landings, all gears (dive and other) were included into a single commercial fleet (Table 7.1). Potential outliers discussed during the assessment webinars were investigated and retained as valid trips.\nIn the SEDAR 84 Stock Synthesis models, the catch was input as biomass (in metric tons) and was treated as if it occurred over an entire fishing season; i.e., each fishing year.\nThe years of the available species-specific self-reported commercial fisher logbook landings and effort data determined the start and end years of the Stock Synthesis models. The start and end years of the model were 2012 and 2022, respectively.\nIt is important to note that the stock was not unexploited at the start year of the available catch time series. The fishery had been ongoing for decades and the total fishing effort in St. Croix in 2012 was undergoing a meaningful decline. Initial F was estimated for the commercial fleet and a corresponding initial equilibrium catch was input. A common option to define an initial equilibrium catch is to use the geometric mean of the first three years of available catches. However, because of the known decline in effort preceding the start year of the assessment, the initial equilibrium catch was configured in initial runs as 30 metric tons, a little over twice the geometric mean of the catches from 2012 - 2014.\nThe input standard error for the landings was set to 0.3. When implemented with few data inputs, Stock synthesis will inherently fit the annual landings time series nearly exactly, regardless of the input standard error. Initial models were set up with a default standard error of 0.01. In addition to nearly exactly fitting the annual landings time series, the models also nearly exactly fit the input initial equilibrium catch. A higher standard error value of 0.3 was used to free up the estimation of the initial equilibrium catch. The sequential model configurations and model development are described later in this report.\nCommercial discards reported by calendar year by Martínez Rivera et al. (2024) were not significant and based on the nature of spearfishing, the predominant dive gear. The assessment assumed no discards.\nAlternative model configurations associated with the commercial fleet data are described later in this report. They included:\n\nThe initial equilibrium catch was explored via likelihood profiling.\nA higher standard error of 2 was explored via sensitivity analysis.\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Size Composition\nGear-specific annual length frequencies for the commercial fleet came from the commercial shore-based port-sampling Trip Interview Program (Godwin et al., 2024). The NOAA Fisheries, Southeast Fisheries Science Center Trip Interview Program collects length and weight data from fish landed by commercial fishing vessels, along with information about fishing areas and gears. Data collection began in 1983 with frequent updates in best practices; the latest being in 2017. The stoplight parrotfish length data from St. Croix included 29,582 length observations across 1,028 unique port sampling interviews.\nAlthough the catch data can be separated into dive and non-dive related gears, 98% of the length measurements for St. Croix Stoplight parrotfish from 2012-2022 were associated with diving. Those data were used to characterize the commercial fleet’s size-based selectivity pattern. Since multiple fish length measurements can be obtained from a single sampled trip, each length does not represent an independent observation. The relative model weighting of the commercial fleet length compositions was based on the number of trips sampled.\nFrom 2012 - 2022, the size data included 1,033 shore-based length measurements obtained across 66 trips. Five trips were flagged and removed as potential outliers with unusually large lengths. Due to low sample sizes of both fish and trips, the fishery-dependent commercial fleet length composition data were collapsed across all years 2012-2022 by implementing the super-period approach in Stock Synthesis.\nThe Trip Interview Program length compositions of the commercial fleet were assumed to be representative of the total catch. Although a federal minimum size limit exists, it does not apply in USVI territorial waters extending from land to 3 nautical miles offshore. Discussion at the data workshop emphasized that the federal regulations do not conclusively affect retention.\nA double normal function was used to model the relative vulnerability of capture by length for the commercial fleet. However, only two parameters were estimated, effectively describing a logistic selectivity for the commercial fleet. The double normal function allows for domed or logistic selectivity. It combines two normal distributions; the first describes the ascending limb, while the second describes the descending limb. Domed selectivity was not explored for St. Croix stoplight parrotfish. However, achieving the logistic shape with the double normal Stock Synthesis pattern facilitated model configurations for SEDAR 84. The two parameters used to achieve a logistic selectivity shape were the size associated with peak selectivity and the width of the ascending limb.",

    "section": "2.2 Survey Data",
    "text": "2.2 Survey Data\n\n2.2.1 Index of Abundance\nThe National Coral Reef Monitoring Program (NCRMP) supports reef fish sampling on hard-bottom habitats from 0 to 30 meters depth (Grove et al., 2021). In St. Croix, sampling began in 2001 and was conducted every year from 2001 to 2012 and then every other year starting in 2015. The data used in SEDAR 84 were from 2012 - 2022 when the survey was conducted island-wide. Data collected prior to 2017 were calibrated to account for a transition from belt transect to a cylinder survey method.\nAnnual mean density and associated standard errors for SEDAR 84 were provided by Grove et al. (2024). In Stock Synthesis, the time series of mean density across all observed sizes were input as an index in numbers with a lognormal error distribution. The associated length composition data, described in the following subsection, suggested that the index reflected the abundance of juveniles and adults.\n\n\n2.2.2 Size Composition\nThe three most recent years of the National Coral Reef Monitoring Program survey in St. Croix provided counts by individual lengths measured to the nearest centimeter. However, before 2017 the length observations were collected in 5-centimeter bins. The length data inputs for both the commercial fleet and the three years of the survey with 1-centimeter length measurements were binned to match the survey’s 2012 and 2015 5-centimeter bins.\nA large proportion of small fish were observed in the National Coral Reef Monitoring Program survey. The smallest two bins, (1 - 6 centimeters) and (6 - 11 centimeters), were collapsed into a single bin (1 - 11 centimeters).\nSince multiple fish can be observed during a single dive, individual lengths are not independent observations. The relative model weighting of the National Coral Reef Monitoring Program survey length compositions across years was based on the number of paired dives.\nThe length compositions provided reasonable support that younger and older fish were available to the National Coral Reef Monitoring Program survey. Selectivity for the National Coral Reef Monitoring Program survey was fixed at 1 for all sizes.\nModels were initially configured in Stock Synthesis with length compositions aggregated across the available years for each source of length data and proceeded stepwise from the simplest configuration to those of moderate complexity. The steps included the inclusion of annual fishery-independent length compositions. The sequential model configurations are described later in this report.",

    "section": "2.3 Life History Data",
    "text": "2.3 Life History Data\nThe life history data used in the assessment included longevity-informed natural mortality, growth, length-weight, and maturity analyzed from 1,801 samples of stoplight parrotfish collected across the U.S. Caribbean from 2013 to 2023 (Rivera Hernández & Shervette, 2024). The largest fish was 43.3 centimeters fork length and the oldest was 20 years old.\nBased on the available information, the stoplight parrotfish population was modeled from age 0 through age 20, and from 0 to 41-centimeters fork length, in 1-centimeter bins, with the largest values for each as plus groups.\nNote that SS3 allows the length bins of the data inputs to be larger than the bins used in the population model. Although the size bins of all the length data inputs were large (≥ 5 centimeters), the model’s simulated population bin size was 1-centimeter bins. When the population is modeled at a higher resolution concerning bin size, the likelihood function, which aims to match the observed data inputs and the simulated population estimates, operates at the resolution of the data inputs.\n\n2.3.1 Growth\nThe SS3 growth formulation requires five parameters:\n\nLength at the youngest age\nLength at the maximum age\nVon Bertalanffy growth parameter (K)\nCoefficient of variation at the youngest age\nCoefficient of variation at the maximum age\n\nParameter estimates for Von Bertalanffy growth parameter (K) and the length at maximum age (L∞) were based on 1,649 samples of stoplight parrotfish collected across the U.S. Caribbean from 2013 to 2023 (Rivera Hernández & Shervette, 2024). When t0 was fixed to -0.06, K was 0.39 and L∞ was 33.2 centimeters fork length. When t0 was estimated, it was -0.52, K was 0.33, and L∞ was 33.8 centimeters fork length.\nThe SEDAR 84 assessment models were configured using the parameter estimates associated with the fixed t0. Furthermore, the estimated size at age zero from otolith analysis by Rivera Hernández & Shervette (2024) was modified in Stock Synthesis so that the length of the youngest age, age 0, was set to zero. Without this modification, the model would be unable to fit the substantial amounts of small (&lt;10cm) stoplight parrotfish observed in the survey size composition data.\nCoefficients of variation for both younger and older ages were initially set to 0.15. Ideally, growth coefficients of variation should be derived from observed length-at-age data, however, the assumed values are consistent with species of moderate growth variability.\nAlternative model configurations associated with the growth data are described later in this report. They included:\n\nA higher growth coefficient of variation of 0.25 for younger ages was explored via sensitivity analysis.\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Morphometric Conversion\nThe relationship between weight in grams and length in millimeters provided by Rivera Hernández & Shervette (2024) was converted to weight in grams and length in centimeters and used as a fixed model input. The length-weight relationship was W = 3.18 x 10-5 * L2.9, with weight (W) in kilograms and length (L) in centimeters.\n\n\n2.3.3 Maturity, Fecundity, and Hermaphroditism\nMaturity was modeled as a logistic function. Parameter estimates for maturity were based on 1,801 samples of stoplight parrotfish collected across the U.S. Caribbean from 2013 to 2023 (Rivera Hernández & Shervette, 2024). The fecundity of stoplight parrotfish was estimated with a proxy (body weight * maturity at age).\nProtogynous hermaphroditism was parameterized into the SS3 assessment framework in two ways. The initial method to model hermaphroditism in Stock Synthesis used the average age of transition, an associated standard deviation, and a maximum transition rate input as fixed parameters in a two-sex model. Additionally, the sex ratio between female and male fish at recruitment was 1, such that all individuals were recruited as females. Although this approach allows for the explicit modeling of numbers by sex and age over time, it could not capture the early age at transition and the overlap of both sexes directly observed across the range of ages studied by Rivera Hernández & Shervette (2024).\nA second method for parameterizing hermaphroditism was explored as a sensitivity analysis. It involved using a female-only model and accounting for sex transition to males as a reduction in fecundity. A fecundity-at-age vector derived from a logistical fit to the Rivera Hernández & Shervette (2024) sex-at-age data was multiplied by maturity-at-age and fecundity-at-age. A caveat of using a single-sex model is that the exclusion of males does not allow for any potential sperm limitation. Although protogynous hermaphrodites tend to have sex ratios skewed towards males at larger sizes, the largest and oldest stoplight parrotfish observed by Rivera Hernández & Shervette (2024) were female.\n\n\n2.3.4 Stock Recruitment\nA Beverton-Holt stock-recruit function was used to parametrize the relationship between spawning output and resulting recruitment of age-0 fish. The stock-recruit function requires three parameters:\n\nSteepness (h) characterizes the initial slope of the ascending limb (i.e., the fraction of recruits produced at 20% of the unfished spawning biomass).\nThe virgin recruitment (R0; estimated in log space) represents the asymptote or unfished recruitment levels.\nThe variance term (sigma R) is the standard deviation of the log of recruitment and describes the amount of year-to-year variation in recruitment.\n\nOnly the virgin recruitment (R0) was estimated. Sigma R and steepness were fixed at 0.7 and 0.99, respectively. The 0.7 sigma R reflects slightly high variation in recruitment. A value of 0.6 is a moderate level of recruitment variability, with lower values indicating lower variability and more predictable year-to-year recruitment. The primary assumption for steepness was that this stock is not a closed population, so recruitment may not be strongly tied to the local spawning stock biomass. In initial model configurations, annual deviations from the stock-recruit function were not estimated. Steepness and R0 were explored via likelihood profiling.\nContinuous recruitment was parameterized in SS3 using four settlement events. Equal proportions of recruits were assigned to each settlement event, and they were spaced such that recruitment would happen in months 1, 4, 7, and 10. This allowed growth to be staggered, reflecting a closer approximation of the observed stock dynamic of year-round spawning activity.\n\n\n2.3.5 Maximum Age and Natural Mortality\nEmpirical estimates of natural mortality (M) can be derived using life history information such as longevity, growth, and maturity. For this assessment, the Natural Mortality Tool was used to estimate M (Cope & Hamel, 2022). Various methods were explored, incorporating factors such as maximum age, the Von Bertalanffy growth parameter (K), theoretical age at size zero (t0), asymptotic size (L∞), and age at 50% maturity.\nInputs for the Natural Mortality Tool were sourced from Rivera Hernández & Shervette (2024), who observed a maximum age of 20 years for stoplight parrotfish in the U.S. Caribbean. However, the average age of 1,649 sampled fish was 5.4 years, with fewer than 1% of aged individuals reaching 13 years or older. More broadly across the Caribbean, a lower maximum age of 9 years was observed, with a suggested maximum lifespan of 12 years. In contrast, a tagging study in Bonaire indicated a potential maximum longevity of 30 years (Choat et al., 2003).\nTable 7.2 summarizes these studies and the empirical methods used to estimate M based on available life history data. The primary approach for determining natural mortality in this assessment was longevity-based (Hamel & Cope, 2022). Lower values of maximum age obtained by Choat et al. (2003) corroborate with the higher estimate of mortality calculated using a meta-analysis available in the FishLife R package Thorson (2019). Although additional methods incorporating growth and maturity were explored using the Natural Mortality Tool, their applicability remains uncertain due to the species’ sex-changing nature. Specifically, the methods Hamel_K, Jensen_k 1, Jensen_k 2, Then_VBGF, Jensen_Amat, and Ri_Ef_Amat do not account for protogynous hermaphroditism (Hamel, 2015; Jensen, 1996, 1997; Rikhter & Efanov, 1976; Then et al., 2015). Notably, the SEDAR 84 available inputs of age at 50% maturity reflect only the sexual maturity of females, while the Von Bertalanffy growth parameters (K), t0, and asymptotic size were fit across males, females, and transitional individuals combined.\nA natural mortality value of 0.27 was used in the initial model runs. This value corresponds with the maximum age of 20 years reported by Rivera Hernández & Shervette (2024). Model configurations incorporating an alternative M value associated with a higher maximum age were explored through sensitivity analyses, which are discussed later in this report.",

    "text": "3.1 Overview\nStock Synthesis models were initially configured using an annual commercial catch time series and size compositions data that were aggregated across the available years for each source of length data. Model development proceeded stepwise from the simplest configuration to those of moderate complexity.\nThe SEDAR 84 model development process started with simple data-limited configurations, followed by exploring data-moderate configurations, individually and combined. The simplest configurations aggregated length compositions across years by implementing the super-period approach in Stock Synthesis. When using super-periods, the estimation model generates annual values, but the likelihood function will compare the expected composite to the data composite across the super-period. When using this approach on the size composition data, Stock Synthesis models will still aim to identify parameter values for selectivity that achieve a fit between the predicted and observed data.\nThe initial setup steps and description of the modeling scenarios documented in this report are listed in Table 7.3. For the SEDAR 84 Stoplight Parrotfish assessment, the data-moderate considerations explored included: (a) indices of abundance, (b) annual fishery-independent size compositions, and (c) recruitment deviations. Additional model configurations were not pursued. For example, annual fishery-dependent size composition data were not considered due to low sample sizes. Similarly, alternative dome-shaped selectivity patterns and selectivity-related time blocks were not explored, based on the reviewed fishery dynamics in St. Croix.\nThe Stock Assessment Continuum Tool was used to develop the initial model setup by importing CSV input files and utilizing its Shiny application interface (Cope (2024)). Starting from the Continuum Tool (ct) model, a series of sequential modifications were applied to represent three key biological and data-related complexities: hermaphroditism (m1), continuous recruitment (m2), and increased catch uncertainty (m3).\nThis report focuses on the results and sensitivities associated with the m3 models, evaluated under the various data configurations described in the previous section. While a full discussion of sensitivity runs is provided later in the report, they are also summarized in Table 7.3 to help familiarize the reader with the terminology used throughout. For instance, model v1_m3_s4 refers to the first scenario (v1, which includes an index and annual fishery-independent size data), the third level modification (m3, reflecting hermaphroditism, continuous recruitment, and higher catch uncertainty), and the fourth sensitivity scenario (s4, assuming one sex).\nDue to the lack of an estimable spawner-recruit relationship across the explored models, a commonly used 40% spawning potential ratio (SPR) was used as a proxy for Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) and as the basis for management reference points. The SPR proxy reflects the ratio of expected lifetime reproductive potential under fished conditions compared to virgin conditions.",

Their approach includes evaluating goodness of fit, information sources and structure, prediction skill, convergence, and model plausibility. Although Carvalho et al. (2021) advise detours and additional model explorations when initial diagnostic tests fail, advanced diagnostics, such as likelihood profiles, retrospective, and jitter analyses, were conducted even when initial tests failed to comprehensively communicate the various model configurations explored to the extent possible.\nThree approaches were used to check for model convergence. They were investigating for the presence of (1) bounded parameters, (2) high final gradients, and (3) a positive definite hessian. As described by Carvalho et al. (2021) checking for bounded parameters can indicate discrepancies with data or model structure. Additionally, small final gradients and a positive definite hessian can indicate that the objective function achieved good convergence.\nThe models presented in this report all had a positive definite Hessian, indicating that each reached a local minimum and a locally optimal fit. None of the models had parameters that were bounded, suggesting the optimization was not constrained by parameter limits. Finally, the parameter gradients in all models were small and well below 0.001, which is commonly used in the R4SS R package to identify large gradients (Table 7.7).",

    "text": "4.2 Correlation Analysis\nHigh correlation among parameters can lead to flat response surfaces and poor model stability. By performing a correlation analysis, modeling assumptions that lead to inadequate configurations can be identified. Because of the highly parameterized nature of stock assessment models, some parameters are expected to be correlated (e.g., stock recruit parameters). However, many strongly correlated parameters suggest reconsidering modeling assumptions and parameterization.\nHigh correlations (correlation coefficients greater than 0.95 or less than -0.95) were observed across nearly all m2 model scenarios (Table 7.4). One particularly noteworthy correlation was between the estimates of initial fishing mortality (Initial F) and unfished recruitment (R0), which exceeded -0.99 in all models except for version v3_m2, where it was slightly lower but still substantial at -0.90.\nIn the initial default configurations of both the m1 and m2 model scenarios, the standard error on the initial equilibrium catch was fixed at a low value of 0.01. This tightly constrained the model to the input catch of 30 metric tons effectively limiting flexibility in estimating the corresponding initial fishing mortality. To address this issue, the standard error was increased to 0.3, allowing the estimated initial catch to diverge from the fixed input value (Table 7.6). This adjustment reduced the overly strong correlation between Initial F and R0 by relaxing the constraint on initial fishing mortality. The effects of increasing the standard error beyond 0.3 are discussed further in the sensitivity analyses section.\nAll m2 and m3 model scenarios showed moderately high correlations (&gt; 0.90) between the two parameters used to define the commercial fleet logistic selectivity: the size at peak selectivity and the width of the ascending limb. Correlations between these selectivity parameters is expected. While estimated values varied slightly among models, they produced similar size-based selectivity curves for the commercial fleet (Figure 8.3).",

    "text": "4.3 Evaluating Variance\nTo check for parameters with high variance, parameter estimates are reported with their resulting standard deviations. Table 7.7 presents the model-estimated values and standard deviations for the main active parameters. While it’s important to consider the scale of each parameter, the results suggest that key parameters are not being estimated with high precision. In particular, the coefficients of variation for initial fishing mortality are relatively high across all models, indicating considerable uncertainty in these estimates.\nFigure 8.4 illustrates how the estimate and uncertainty for the unfished recruitment (R0) and virgin spawning stock biomass change throughout the sequential steps of model development. In general, increasing the complexity of the model across the model scenarios explored results in lower values for both of these parameters. The uncertainty across the response surface for key parameters is further examined later in the report using likelihood profiles.\nStock Synthesis also provides estimates and standard deviations for derived quantities such as unfished spawning stock biomass, initial year spawning biomass, and the initial depletion. Initial depletion is defined as the initial biomass divided by the unfished biomass. Table 7.5 shows this information and it is also plotted in Figures 8.5 (a) and 8.5 (b).\nCompared to the other m3 model scenarios, Model v3_m3 had extremely high uncertainty for fishing mortality and the highest initial depletion reflected as the lowest spawning biomass ratio (SSB Initial/SSB Unfished) (Table 7.5; Figure 8.5 (c)). All of the m3 model scenarios resulted in relatively high uncertainty and limited contrast, with most years encompassing the 95% confidence intervals across the entire time series (Figure 8.5). The sensitivity runs described later build on the exploration of uncertainty in these model scenarios and help interpret conditions under which all of the model scenarios increasingly converge.",

    "text": "4.4 Jitter Analysis\nJitter analysis is a relatively simple method that can be used to assess model stability and to determine whether the search algorithm has found a global, as opposed to local, solution. The premise is that all starting values are randomly altered (or ‘jittered’) by an input constant value, and the model is rerun from the new starting values. If the resulting population trajectories across many runs converge to the same solution, this provides support that a global minimum has been obtained. This process is not fault-proof; no guarantee can ever be made that the ‘true’ solution has been found or that the model does not contain misspecification. However, if the jitter analysis results are consistent, it provides additional support that the model is performing well and has come to a stable solution. For this assessment, a jitter value of 0.2 was applied to the starting values, and 30 runs were completed. The jitter value defines a uniform distribution in cumulative normal space to generate new initial parameter values (Methot et al., 2020).\nConsistent with earlier results indicating that the models reached local minima (positive definite Hessian), the jitter analysis also performed well across all model scenarios (Figure 8.6). Importantly, no jitter runs produced a lower likelihood than the best fit already identified for each model.",

    "text": "4.5 Residual Analysis\nThe primary approach to investigate model performance was a residual analysis of model fit to each data set (e.g., catch, length compositions, indices). Any temporal trend in model residuals or disproportionately high residual values can indicate model misspecification and poor performance. Ideally, residuals are randomly distributed, conform to the assumed error structure for that data source, and are not of extreme magnitude. Any extremely positive or negative residual patterns indicate poor model performance and potential unaccounted-for process or observation error.\n\n4.5.1 Catch\nAll models closely matched the observed 2012 - 2022 catch data, which was expected given the data-limited configurations used. These setups don’t provide much additional information beyond the catch itself, so the model has little room to estimate catch values that differ from the input data. The effect of increasing the standard error on the catch to 0.3 during the model development m3 scenario was to give the model more flexibility in estimating initial equilibrium catch and corresponding initial fishing mortality. This adjustment allowed the model to explore alternative fits while remaining informed by the assumption of a larger level of historically sustained catch. Increasing the standard error from 0.01 to 0.3 resulted in lower estimates of the initial equilibrium catch (Table 7.6). This topic will be revisited in the sensitivity analyses, where model runs with even higher catch standard error of 2 are compared. Additional justifications for further allowing the estimated initial equilibrium catch to differ from the assumed initial equilibrium catch of 30 metric tons is further investigated via likelihood profiles (See Section 4.7.2).\n\n\n4.5.2 Indices\nFor the models without recruitment deviation being estimated (model scenarios b_m2, and v1_m2), the predicted National Coral Reef Monitoring Program index is flat (Figure 8.7). In the model scenarios with estimated recruitment deviations (v3_m3 and v7_m3), there is some improved fit to the index. Notably, the highest uncertainty in the index was observed in 2015 and 2017, and none of the models fit well with the highest value observed in 2017 (Figure 8.7).\n\n\n4.5.3 Length compositions\nFigure 8.8 shows the cumulative fit across all years between the observed and predicted length composition for the two model scenarios that had aggregated size data (a_m3 and v3_m3). Figures 8.9, 8.10, and 8.11 provide the cumulative and the year-specific length compositions for the model scenarios that included annual fishery-independent size data (b_m3, v1_m3, and v7_m3).\nAmong the models with the annual fishery-independent size data (b_m3, v1_m3, and v7_m3), the model with recruitment deviation being estimated (v7_m2), has improved fits to the annual National Coral Reef Monitoring Program length composition data (Figure 8.11 (b)). In the scenarios without recruitment deviations (b_m3 and v_m3), the predicted composition is identical across years, which leads to overestimating the proportion of the smallest size and underestimating intermediate or large sizes in 2012, 2017, and 2021 (Figures 8.9 (b) and 8.10 (b)). This is also evident in Figure 8.12 where the observed and predicted mean length by year are plotted.",

    "text": "4.6 Retrospective Analysis\nA retrospective analysis is a helpful approach for investigating the consistency of terminal year model estimates (e.g., SSB, Recruits, Fs) and is often considered a sensitivity exploration of impacts on key parameters from changes in data. The analysis sequentially removes a year of data and reruns the model. Suppose the resulting estimates of derived quantities such as SSB or recruitment differ significantly. In such a case, serial over- or underestimation of important quantities can indicate that the model has an unidentified process error and could require reassessing model assumptions. It is expected that removing data will lead to slight differences between the new terminal year estimates and the estimates for that year in the model with the complete time series of data. Estimates in years before the terminal year may have increasingly reliable information on cohort strength. Therefore, slight differences are usually expected between model runs as more years of size composition data are sequentially removed. Ideally, the difference in estimates will be slight and randomly distributed above and below the estimates from the model with complete data set time series.\nThe results of a five-year retrospective analysis are plotted in Figure 8.13. When more than 3 years are removed, the estimates of key quantities change. The sensitivity to the removal of 2019 and 2018 data reflect some model instability. Although all retrospectives show wide 95% confidence intervals, the retrospective pattern was most divergent in the scenario with recruitment deviations and annual fishery-independent size data, scenario v7_m2.",

The analysis is performed by holding a given parameter at a constant value and rerunning the model. The model is run repeatedly over a range of reasonable parameter values. Ideally, the graph of change in likelihood values against parameter values will yield a well-defined minimum. When the profile plot shows conflicting signals or is flat across its range, the given parameter may be poorly estimated.\nTypically, profiling is carried out for key parameters, particularly those defining the stock-recruit relationship (steepness, virgin recruitment, and sigma R). Profiles were explored across virgin recruitment (R0), initial equilibrium catch, and steepness.\n\n4.7.1 Unfished Recruitment (R0)\nFigure 8.14 shows the profile likelihood for the natural log of the unfished recruitment parameter of the Beverton – Holt stock-recruit function for St. Croix stoplight parrotfish across model scenarios (a_m3, b_m3, v1_m3, v3_m3, and v7_m3). All models show conflicting signals and relatively poorly defined minimums, with a range of equally plausible values reflected by only small changes in likelihood. Figure 8.15 shows the corresponding change in the MSY SPR 40% across the range of unfished recruitment values explored.\n\n\n4.7.2 Initial Equilibrium Catch\nFigure 8.16 shows the profile likelihood for the initial equilibrium catch for St. Croix stoplight parrotfish across model scenarios (a_m3, b_m3, v1_m3, v3_m3, and v7_m3). Except for model scenario v3_m3, the models suggest improved fit associated with smaller values of fixed initial equilibrium catch. Meanwhile, v3_m3 shows a minimum of 24 metric tons. Figure 8.17 shows the corresponding change in the MSY SPR 40% across the range of initial equilibrium catch values explored. This suggests that given further flexibility the initial equilibrium may be estimated lower and was further examined through sensitivity runs.\n\n\n4.7.3 Steepness\nFigure 8.18 shows the profile likelihood for the steepness parameter of the Beverton – Holt stock-recruit function for St. Croix stoplight parrotfish across model scenarios (a_m3, b_m3, v1_m3, v3_m3, and v7_m3).

Of all the sensitivities explored, the m3_s1 sensitivities resulted in the smallest change to the derived quantities relative to the corresponding m3 sensitivity model configurations (Tables 7.6, 7.8, 7.9, and 7.10). Growth is a critical process in all stock assessment models, and in this assessment, the CV for young fish was a particularly relevant sensitivity to examine due to the large number of small individuals (less than 11 cm) observed in the fishery-independent survey length compositions. While additional sensitivities related to growth were considered, they will be revisited in the discussion section as part of the research recommendations. The current models use the best available growth parameters from Rivera Hernández & Shervette (2024).\n\n\n4.8.2 Natural Mortality\nThe second sensitivity scenario (s2) explored a lower natural mortality of 0.18, corresponding to a higher maximum age of 30 years. This higher maximum age, associated with tagging data by Choat et al. (2003), is significantly greater than the maximum age observed by Rivera Hernández & Shervette (2024). Although the maximum age is often larger than the maximum age observed, particularly for species that have sustained historical fishing pressure, the Hamel (2015) method estimates natural mortality based on the maximum observed age. In this assessment, age is the only factor used to inform the estimate of natural mortality, making it important to consider the implications of assuming a lower M, which reflects a less productive stock. The m3_s2 sensitivity models showed notable differences from the corresponding m3 configurations. These differences included lower initial equilibrium catch, reduced MSY estimates, lower spawning stock biomass ratios, and higher fishing mortality ratios (Tables 7.6, 7.8, 7.9, and 7.10).\n\n\n4.8.3 Single Sex Model\nThe third sensitivity scenario (s3) explored an alternative method for parameterizing hermaphroditism. This approach used a female-only model, accounting for sex transition by reducing fecundity rather than explicitly modeling males. Interestingly, this configuration produced estimates of initial catch that were identical to the corresponding m3 models, slightly higher MSY estimates, similar spawning stock biomass ratios, and slightly lower fishing mortality ratios (Tables 7.6, 7.8, 7.9, and 7.10). This result demonstrates that the direct parameterization—despite its caveats, particularly for species where not all females transition, can be restructured differently while yielding broadly consistent outcomes.\nHowever, a key limitation of the m3_s3 single-sex models is the inability to capture potential sperm limitation due to the disproportionate removal of males, which may increase the risk of reduced reproductive output. As such, both model configurations provide useful perspectives and highlight the need for additional data and consideration to fully characterize uncertainty related to hermaphroditic biology in stoplight parrotfish. This uncertainty may represent a greater risk of overfishing compared to gonochoric species.\n\n\n4.8.4 Standard Error on Catch\nThe fourth sensitivity scenario (s4) examined the effect of further relaxing the information that informs the initial model conditions. In the m3 model scenarios, a standard error of 0.3 was applied to the landings data (see Section 2.1.1). Compared to the m2 model scenarios, this resulted in lower estimates of initial equilibrium catch. However, likelihood profiles (see Section 4.7.2) showed improved fit at even lower fixed estimates of equilibrium catch. This led to the exploration of increased input uncertainty using a standard error of 2.0 associated with the input equilibrium catch.\nEffectively, this provides greater flexibility in estimating initial conditions, which are known to be difficult to resolve without longer time series. The m3_s4 sensitivities produced much lower estimates of initial catch and MSY, higher fishing mortality ratios, and similar biomass ratios compared to the m3 models (Tables 7.6, 7.8, 7.9, and 7.10).\nThese results highlight the significance of uncertainty in initial conditions. While the model fit improved with lower assumed historical catches, this also suggested a less productive stock. This sensitivity underscores the value of longer historical data series. Without them, there is considerable uncertainty in defining the initial conditions, and the m3_s4 results imply that if early landings were smaller than assumed in the M3 models, the stock may be inherently less productive.\nFigure 8.20 shows that the estimates and associated uncertainty for unfished recruitment (R0) and virgin spawning stock biomass in the m3_s4 sensitivity scenarios are shifted toward smaller values compared to the m3 model results (See Figure 8.4). The time series of derived quantities for the m3_s4 scenarios are provided in Figure 8.21 and appear broadly similar to those from the m3 models shown in Figure 8.5.\n\n\n4.8.5 Standard Error on Catch and Natural Mortality\nThe fifth sensitivity scenario (s5) explored the combined implications of two key sensitivities that had notable effects on model outcomes: increased uncertainty around initial equilibrium catch and lower natural mortality associated with higher maximum age. By evaluating both assumptions simultaneously, this scenario investigates the compounding uncertainty associated with the baseline M3 model configurations.\nThe combined effect of these changes resulted in lower estimates of MSY and initial catch and substantially higher estimates of relative fishing mortality (Tables 7.6, 7.8, 7.9, and 7.10). As shown in Figure 8.22, the estimates and uncertainty for unfished recruitment (R0) and virgin spawning stock biomass in the m3_s5 models are shifted to smaller values and show more consistency across configurations. The time series of derived quantities in Figure 8.23 indicate that the m3_s5 models converge on lower spawning output and higher fishing mortality relative to the M3 scenarios.\n\n\n4.8.6 Single Sex Model, Standard Error on Catch, and Natural Mortality\nSimilar to the s3 sensitivity run, the sixth and final sensitivity scenario (s6) was conducted to evaluate whether the dynamics and implications observed in the s5 scenario persisted when the model was reconfigured as a single-sex model. The results from the m3_s6 sensitivity runs were closely aligned with those of the m3_s5 scenarios, indicating that the combined effects of lower natural mortality and increased uncertainty in initial catch are robust to the choice of sex structure in the model (Tables 7.6, 7.8, 7.9, and 7.10).\n\n\n\n\nCarvalho, F., Winker, H., Courtney, D., Kapur, M., Kell, L., Cardinale, M., Schirripa, M., Kitakado, T., Yemane, D., Piner, K.

    "text": "This assessment presents a suite of model configurations developed to address key uncertainties in data and model structure, using an integrated framework to characterize the stock status of stoplight parrotfish in St. Croix. Overall, the results broadly indicate that overfishing is not occurring and the stock is not overfished. Despite the broad range of scenarios explored, nearly all model configurations supported this conclusion, with only one sensitivity (m3_s6) reflecting an overfishing status Table 7.10. Nonetheless, diagnostics and sensitivities highlighted critical caveats, primarily stemming from limited and low-contrast data inputs.\nA major source of uncertainty stems from the unknown initial catch conditions. The short time series, coarse resolution in length binning, and absence of early fishery information make it challenging for the models to resolve the historical state of the stock.\nNatural mortality and assumptions about the historical catch levels were two of the most influential parameters across model sensitivities. The combined sensitivity scenario (s5) showed that allowing the model to estimate initial catch and assuming lower natural mortality led to lower MSY estimates and higher fishing mortality ratios. These patterns were robust across both sex-structured and single-sex model configurations. These outcomes reinforce the value of structured sensitivity analyses to explore uncertainty and variability in model results. Looking ahead, future research should consider the development of model grids or ensemble approaches to formally capture uncertainty and improve the robustness of management advice.\nRecruitment deviations, when estimated, are particularly uncertain, given the limited years of available data and large length bins. However, the availability of fishery-independent length data from the National Coral Reef Monitoring Program provides a valuable information source. The observed abundance of small fish may allow better inference of recruitment in future assessments. Finer resolution data (e.g., using 1 cm bins for specific years) could improve model performance and reduce uncertainty.\nIntegrated models such as Stock Synthesis are powerful not only for synthesizing multiple data sources but also for making key assumptions explicit and testable. Without this flexibility, assessments risk producing outputs that must be taken at face value, with little opportunity to evaluate the effects of underlying assumptions.\nWhile not every species will have sufficient data for an integrated assessment, wherever possible, structured scenario testing—such as that conducted here—should be pursued to explore alternative hypotheses and better understand the drivers of population dynamics. Such efforts strengthen the scientific foundation for management advice and help balance the need for both rigorous and practical assessment frameworks.\nGiven that stoplight parrotfish is currently the only parrotfish species in the complex with a SEDAR assessment, it may be worth reconsidering if catch limits for the entire parrotfish unit should be based on the combined historical average landings of two indicator species, as currently implemented, particularly if stoplight parrotfish catch continues to represent a significant portion of the total.\nAdditionally, this assessment assumes an open population with recruitment not tightly linked to local spawning stock. This assumption could benefit from future exploration of regional connectivity, as it has implications for both model structure and management scale. If connectivity across islands is strong, larger-scale stock definitions or spatially explicit metapopulation modeling approaches may be warranted.\nFinally, the stepwise modeling approach used in this assessment offers a framework that could be applied to other Caribbean species. Expanding the approach through targeted data collection and method development could improve the timeliness and robustness of stock assessments across the region. This will require continued support for long-term monitoring programs, higher-resolution data collection, and investment in model development and bridging exercises to deliver science-based, real-time management advice.",
