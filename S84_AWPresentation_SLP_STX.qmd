::: {.notes}
The Stoplight Parrotfish stock was defined by the CFMC Island-based Fishery Management Plan. The St. Croix stock is defined as the population within the U.S. Virgin Island’s territorial  waters; i.e., the island platform of St. Croix and the adjacent EEZ.

## Data Sources Overview

1.  **Landings** from self-reported commercial fisher logbooks
2.  **Length compositions** from shore-based port sampling
3.  **Length compositions** from a fishery-independent survey of reef fish
4.  **Index of abundance** from a fishery-independent survey of reef fish
5.  **Life history information** from otolith analysis and gonad histology

---

##   Data Workshop Outcomes

-   Use life history data made available in SEDAR working papers.
-   Only use commercial landings data starting in 2012.
-   Identify and flag outliers.
-   Utilize the various diving gears to establish a SCUBA gear group.
-   Assume commercial discards are negligible.
-   Utilize TIP lengths from 2012 to 2022 to inform selectivity.
-   Use the NCRMP Stoplight Parrotfish data for STX from 2012 to 2022.
-   Do not consider the fishery-dependent information for an abundance indices.

## Modeling Approach

-   [Stock Synthesis](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/ss3-website/) V3.30.22 was the modeling approach applied in the current SEDAR 84 assessment because of compatibility with the available data and consistency with standard practices.
-   40% SPR used as a proxy for MSY.
-   Tools for working with Stock Synthesis
    - [r4ss](https://r4ss.github.io/r4ss/): Create plots and tables of Stock Synthesis output and functions to work with Stock Synthesis in R.
    - [ss3diags](https://pifscstockassessments.github.io/ss3diags/): Run advanced diagnostics for Stock Synthesis models.
    - [Stock Assessment Continuum Tool](https://github.com/shcaba/SS-DL-tool) (previously the SS-DL-tool) a shiny app that includes Extended Simple Stock Synthesis and Simple Stock Synthesis in its functionality.

---

## Assessment Method

- Began with data-limited models using super-period length compositions
    -   Steepness fixed at 0.99
    -   Sigma R fixed at 0.7
-   Model progression tracked biological/data complexities:
    -   m1: Hermaphroditism
    -   m2: Continuous recruitment
    -   m3: Increased catch uncertainty
-   Progressed to data-moderate models incorporating:
    -   Abundance indices
    -   Annual fishery-independent length compositions
    -   Recruitment deviations

## IV. Discussion & Uncertainties

-   Assessment uses a stepwise, scenario-based framework to explore uncertainty
-   Natural mortality and initial catch are highly influential in model outcomes 
-   Short time series (2012-2022) and coarse length bins (2012 & 2015)
-   Recruitment deviations are uncertain but improved by fishery-independent data

---

# V. Conclusions & Recommendations

---

## Key Findings

-   Model indicates no overfishing and not overfished
-   Only one sensitivity (m3_s6) showed potential overfishing status
-   Initial catch conditions are a major source of uncertainty
-   Results are robust across models but limited by low-contrast data

---

## Assessment Research Recommendations

-   Reevaluate use of combined indicator species for setting ACLs
-   Consider larger-scale stock definitions due to high larval connectivity
-   Expand modeling to reflect regional metapopulation dynamics
-   Continue long-term monitoring with 1-cm length resolution
-   Decouple initial condition from long-term sustainable yields
-   Support development of ensembles to capture uncertainty
-   Promote scenario testing for other Caribbean species

---

## Data Workshop Research Recommendations

Life History

- Optimize sample sizes
- Ensure adequate coverage of small and large fish

Length Composition

- Increase TIP sample size and improve trip coverage (e.g., night fishing)
- Link TIP and CCL via integrated data system
- Investigate weight-at-length trends and trip-level representativeness
- Develop a more holistic sampling strategy

---

## Data Workshop Recommendations (cont.)

-   Commercial Landings
  -   Investigate trends in effort, gear, and environmental drivers
  -   Explore hindcasting and develop gear grouping and outlier flagging tools
-   Discards & Mortality
  -   Quantify **shark depredation** and discard mortality
  -   Promote discard reporting through outreach and education

---

## Data Workshop Recommendations (cont.)

-   Fishery-Independent (NCRMP)
    -   Investigate changes across consistent sites (e.g., Buck Island);
    -   Investigate habitat change and expand to seagrass/mangrove areas
    -   Explore unsurveyed turbid regions

-   Fishery-Dependent Indices
    -   Apply ecosystem lens to fisher targeting behavior
    -   Filter out lobster/conch-only trips
    -   Examine effort vs. catch disconnect in dive data

---

## 1. Convergence

-   Positive definite Hessian, indicating local optimal fit
-   No parameters were bounded, suggesting unconstrained optimization
-   Parameter gradients were small (all < 0.001), supporting convergence

---

## 2. Correlation Analysis

- No correlations greater than 0.95 or less than -0.95
- Moderately high correlations (> 0.90) commercial fleet logistic selectivity
  -   length at peak selectivity
  -   width of the ascending limb
