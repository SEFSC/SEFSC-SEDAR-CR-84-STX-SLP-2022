# Executive Summary {.unnumbered}

The SEDAR 84 St. Croix stoplight parrotfish (Sparisoma viride) stock assessment process consisted of four webinars between April 2024 and October 2024. The data available for the assessment included:

-   An annual species-specific catch time series from commercial logbooks
-   Fishery-dependent length compositions from commercial port sampling
-   Fishery-independent length compositions from a reef fish survey
-   A fishery-independent index of abundance from a reef fish survey
-   Life history information from otolith analysis and gonad histology

The assessment used Stock Synthesis, a statistical catch-at-age model [@methot2020]. Stock Synthesis V3.30.22 models were initially configured with an annual catch time series and length compositions that were aggregated across the available years for each source of length data. Model development proceeded stepwise from the simplest configuration to those of moderate complexity. Those sequential steps included the inclusion of the index of abundance and annual fishery-independent length compositions. Models were run with and without the estimation of recruitment deviations. Finally, the sensitivity of the assessment outcomes was investigated using alternative inputs for longevity-informed natural mortality, coefficient of variation on growth, parameterization of hermaphroditism, and uncertainty on initial model equilibrium catch.

Model diagnostics checked for convergence, goodness-of-fit, model consistency, and prediction skill by evaluating gradients, residual plots, likelihood profiles, hindcast cross-validation, correlation, and jitter analyses.
