# Executive Summary {.unnumbered}

The SEDAR 84 St. Croix Stoplight Parrotfish stock assessment process consisted of four webinars between April 2024 and October 2024. The assessment used Stock Synthesis (SS3), a statistical catch-at-age model [@methot2020]. SS3 uses a population model, an observation model, and an estimation model and applies a likelihood function in the estimation process. SS3 has been applied extensively worldwide for stock assessment evaluations [@methot2013].

The Stock Assessment Continuum Tool was used to configure initial assessment models utilizing a data-limited modeling framework [@cope2024]. Models were initially configured using an annual catch time series and composite length data. Model development proceeded stepwise from the simplest configuration to those of moderate complexity, with some diagnostics, namely retrospective and likelihood profiling, being carried out at each step to examine the stability of parameter estimation. Two additional population features were configured outside the Stock Assessment Continuum Tool: hermaphroditism and continuous recruitment (i.e., protracted spawning throughout the year).

Applying SS3 with a data-limited framework resulted in inconclusive results due to relatively few years of data, small sample sizes, and low contrast in the available time series. The high correlations between key parameters R0 and the initial equilibrium fishing mortality rate and associated flat likelihood profiles indicated that the stock status was not reliably estimable. Since the SEDAR 84 stock assessment cannot estimate the overfished status for the St. Croix Stoplight Parrotfish stock, their status remains unknown. However, the lack of decline in the fishery-independent abundance index concurrent with a decrease in landings suggests that the St. Croix Stoplight Parrotfish is not likely to be undergoing overfishing.
